# Welcome to the C Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we are learning C, the root of many high-level languages and a classic choice for system programming.

## Contents

Inside this C folder, you'll find the following:

1. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in C.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a C environment and run the programs:

1. **Install a C compiler:** Most Unix-like operating systems come with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) installed. On Windows, you might want to check out Mingw-w64.
2. **Compile a Program:** To compile a C program, use the `gcc` command followed by the `.c` file name and `-o` flag with output file name. For example, `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`.
3. **Run a Program:** After successful compilation, you can run the program using `./program_name` (e.g., `./hello_world`).
