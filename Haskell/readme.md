# Welcome to the Haskell Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we focus on Haskell, a statically typed, purely functional language.

## Contents

Inside this Haskell folder, you'll find the following:

1. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in Haskell.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a Haskell environment and run the programs:

1. **Install Haskell:** You can install Haskell by following the instructions provided on the official Haskell website: [https://www.haskell.org/downloads/](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/).
2. **Run a Program:** To run a Haskell program, use the `runhaskell` command followed by the `.hs` file name. For instance, to run `hello_world.hs`, use the command `runhaskell hello_world.hs`.
