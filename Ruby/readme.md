# Welcome to the Ruby Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we concentrate on Ruby, a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

## Contents

Inside this Ruby folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Hello World:** A basic Ruby program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in Ruby.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a Ruby environment and run the programs:

1. **Install Ruby:** You can install Ruby by following the instructions provided on the official Ruby website: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. **Run a Program:** To run a Ruby program, use the `ruby` command followed by the `.rb` file name. For example, `ruby hello_world.rb`.
