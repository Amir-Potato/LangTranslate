# Welcome to the C++ Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we concentrate on C++, a high-performance language widely used for systems programming.

## Contents

Inside this C++ folder, you'll find the following:

1. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in C++.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a C++ environment and run the programs:

1. **Install a C++ compiler:** If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you likely already have g++ installed. On Windows, you might want to check out Mingw-w64.
2. **Compile a Program:** To compile a C++ program, use the `g++` command followed by the `.cpp` file name and `-o` flag with output file name. For example, `g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world`.
3. **Run a Program:** After successful compilation, you can run the program using `./program_name` (e.g., `./hello_world`).
