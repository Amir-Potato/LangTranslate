# Welcome to the Elixir Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we dive into Elixir, a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Contents

Inside this Elixir folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Hello World:** A basic Elixir program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in Elixir.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up an Elixir environment and run the programs:

1. **Install Elixir:** You can install Elixir by following the instructions provided on the official Elixir website: [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
2. **Run a Program:** To run an Elixir program, use the `elixir` command followed by the `.exs` file name. For instance, to run `hello_world.exs`, use the command `elixir hello_world.exs`.
