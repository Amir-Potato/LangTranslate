# Welcome to the Zig Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we delve into Zig, a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

## Contents

Inside this Zig folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Hello World:** A basic Zig program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in Zig.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a Zig environment and run the programs:

1. **Install Zig:** You can install Zig by following the instructions provided on the official Zig website: [https://ziglang.org/download/](https://ziglang.org/download/).
2. **Run a Program:** To run a Zig program, use the `zig run` command followed by the `.zig` file name. For example, `zig run hello_world.zig`.
