# Welcome to our Polyglot Project!

This is a fun, free-time project the Duotato team are learning new programming languages. 

In this repository, you will find folders for each programming language we are learning, each containing various programs showcasing our progress. 

## Languages

We're exploring a diverse range of programming languages including:

- Haskell
- Rust
- C++
- C
- C#
- Go
- Elixir
- Ruby
- Lua
- Zig

## Contents

Inside each language folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Hello World:** A basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** An implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode.
3. **Feature Showcase:** An additional program demonstrating some unique feature or characteristic of the language.

## Getting Started

Each language folder contains a `README.md` file detailing how to set up the environment for that language, compile and run the programs.
