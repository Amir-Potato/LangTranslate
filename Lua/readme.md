# Welcome to the Lua Learning Directory!

This directory is part of a larger project where we're learning new programming languages. In this specific folder, we are learning Lua, a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

## Contents

Inside this Lua folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Hello World:** A basic Lua program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **LeetCode TwoSum Solution:** Our implementation of the TwoSum problem from LeetCode, written in Lua.

## Getting Started

Here are some steps to set up a Lua environment and run the programs:

1. **Install Lua:** You can install Lua by following the instructions provided on the official Lua website: [https://www.lua.org/start.html](https://www.lua.org/start.html).
2. **Run a Program:** To run a Lua program, use the `lua` command followed by the `.lua` file name. For example, `lua hello_world.lua`.
